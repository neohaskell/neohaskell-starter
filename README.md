# Welcome to the NeoHaskell Playground!

Hello and welcome! ðŸŽ‰ We're excited to have you explore the **NeoHaskell Playground**, a dynamic space where you can dive into NeoHaskell, an evolving dialect of Haskell designed for both newcomers and seasoned developers. NeoHaskell focuses on simplicity, productivity, and developer happiness, making coding both efficient and enjoyable.

## Getting Started

To start using this playground, you'll need to install [`devenv.sh`](https://devenv.sh/). This setup works on WSL2, MacOS, and Linux. Let's get you up and running!

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/neohaskell-playground.git
    cd neohaskell-playground
    ```

2. **Enable devenv**

    ```bash
    devenv shell
    ```

3. **Edit using Visual Studio Code**
   You can use whatever text editor you like, but this playground comes
   pre-configured with recommended VSCode extensions so you can get up
   and running quickly.

### Building and Running the Project

With the repo set up, you can easily build and run your projects using the following commands:

1. **Build the Project**

    ```bash
    neo-build
    ```

2. **Run the Project**

    ```bash
    neo-run
    ```

And that's it! You're now ready to explore and experiment with NeoHaskell. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue on our GitHub page, or even better, joining our Discord! We're here to help!
